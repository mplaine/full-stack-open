# Countries

A web application that allows to view information from different countries, including the weather report.


## Configuration

Go to the [root directory of the web application](./) and make a copy of the `.env.example` file as an `.env` file:
```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

In `.env`, change the value of the `VITE_OWM_API_KEY` environment variable to your own API key, which you can get from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/).
